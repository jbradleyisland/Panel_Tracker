## Execute Panel Tracker

**Panel Tracker** synchronizes a designated Revit model to Sharepoint and BIM 360 information to produce a visual tracker within Revit that is accessible through BIM 360

* Running the script will initiate a project setup process, the script needs the panel tracker Sharepoint link, the BIM 360 Docs folder location for storage, as well as locaton information for the parameters that the script will use to update the model.

* The Revit model must be formatted so that the view template shows the appropriate model information within the BIM 360 Docs viewer and should include material settings for the script to apply to the project panels.
